Programming Samples


C# 

Redirect rewrite


Purpose:

This script received a CSV file produced by google webmaster tools, the CSV file was populated with URLs that threw HTTP errors.
The URLs were parsed for a SKU, if a SKU was found the SKU queried a database that tracked all SKUs and their absolute address.
After the correct URL was retrieved from the database the incorect URL and correct URL were wrote to a text file to create a redirect rule.


Java

Data Structures: 

Lab projects from classes.

Towers of Hanoi: Classic recursion exercise. 

Token Ring Sim: Project was to replicate a token ring network using a double linked list.


Roomba:

The Roomba project was a connection management utility I created for our class to use. The class was using the iRobot Create
to do programming exercises, connecting to the Roomba via blue tooth was unreliable and difficult for many students.
I wrote this utility to automate the process. The utility scans possible ports for a BT/Roomba connection until one is found(or not)
and automatically connects to it.


JavaScript:

Begining of a CRM for Janitorial companies using AngularJS & Node.js & MongoDB w/mongoose.
